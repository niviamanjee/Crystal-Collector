# Crystal-Collector

This is an interactive game where the user has to collect gems, each containing a specific value. Those values are added when the user collects each gem. The goal of the game is to equate the value of collected gems to the value of a given random number during each round of the game. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of JQuery.
